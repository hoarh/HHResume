		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<img src="Images/hhoar.jpg">
		<p>Hello! Nice to meet you. My name is Hannah. I am 24 years old. I am the middle of three girls; Katie, a social worker in Burlington, Vermont, is 26, and Maddie, a student at Middlebury College, is 20. We also have two dogs (both girls- my poor dad!) named Molly and Elsie (RIP Rosie). I love dogs, books and cookies. Feel free to check out my <a href="resume.html">Resume</a> to learn more about my activities and work experience!</p>
