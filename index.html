		<p>Hello! Nice to meet you. My name is Hannah. I am 24 years old. I am the middle of three girls; Katie, a social worker in Burlington, Vermont, is 26, and Maddie, a student at Middlebury College, is 20. We also have two dogs (both girls- my poor dad!) named Molly and Elsie (RIP Rosie). I love dogs, books and cookies, and I am passionate about education. Feel free to check out my <a href="resume.html">resume</a> to learn more about my activities and work experience!</p>
